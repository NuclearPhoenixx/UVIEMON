\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose of the Document}


This document describes the \gls{SQA} activities that will be
performed in the development of the the operating system kernel FlightOS.
The document is applicable for all versions of FlightOS and and shall be updated
as needed.\\

\noindent
FlightOS targets the \gls{SSDP}, and to a lesser extent, its
compatible predecessor, the \gls{MPPB} v2.x \cite{MPPB}.
It is intended to be used in unmanned space applications of (at least)
Software Criticality Level C. \\

\noindent
This document follows the document structure for software product assurance
plans found in Annex B of ECSS-Q-ST-80C \cite{ECSS80C}.

\chapter{System Overview}

In the course of the \gls{NGAPP} activities, an evaluation of the \gls{MPPB}
was performed in a joint effort of \gls{RSA} and the Department of Astrophysics
of the \gls{UVIE}. While the original intent of the work of \gls{UVIE} was to
quantify the performance of the \gls{Xentium} \glspl{DSP} and the \gls{MPPB} as a
whole with regard to on-board data treatment and reduction in an astronomical
mission setting, it was found that, given the highly innovative nature of this new
processing platform, a novel approach was needed concerning the management of
system resources, \gls{DMA} mechanics and \gls{DSP} program design for best
efficiency and turnover rates. Consequently, \gls{UVIE} developed an experimental
operating system to stably drive the \gls{DSP} cores and the \gls{MPPB} close
to its performance limit. FlightOS is a development based on this operating system
concept.\\

\noindent
Further details on FlightOS may be found in \cite{ssdpOS}.


\chapter{Software Product Assurance Programme Implementation}

\section{Organisation}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{images/software_dev_structure}
	\caption{A typical organisational structure in a software development
		 group.}
	\label{fig:sw_dev_org}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The \gls{SQA} organisation (\fig{fig:sw_dev_org}) for the development of FlightOS
is commensurate to the scope and size of the working group dedicated to
\gls{FSW} development at the Department of Astrophysics of the University of
Vienna.\\

\noindent
As projects are typically carried out by a small group of people, several of
the project tasks may be executed by one and the same person.\\

\noindent
There is no formal \gls{PA} section at the Department of Astrophysics.
Instead, the \gls{PAM}, together with the other team leaders, forms a \gls{PA}
group for the specific project. In particular, the \gls{PAM} also takes over the
role of the \gls{SQAM} and nominates people as \gls{SQ} personnel as needed
and if applicable.\\

\noindent
\gls{PAM} and (internal) \gls{SQ} personnel maintain a level of independence
from the project and the software development.



\section{Responsibilities}

Formal responsibilities of the \gls{PAM} and \gls{SQ} personnel include process
and product assessments:

\begin{itemize}
	\item System and System Design Reviews
	\item Requirements Management
	\item Test Management
	\item \gls{NCR} Manangement
	\item \gls{SPR} Manangement
	\item Document Reviews and Review Packages
	\item Software Development Records
	\item Software Configuration Management
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Given the organisational and personnel constraints described in the previous
section, activities of the \gls{SQ} personnel shall be conducted in an informal
way between the members. The \gls{PAM} shall assess and give assistance as to
the formal aspects of the product and process assurance. Examples of this
are configuration management or the state of completeness of review packages.\\

\noindent
The \gls{PAM} ensures the compliance with the software development processes
described in the corresponding software development plan if applicable.\\

\noindent
The main responsibilities of \gls{SQA} shall remain with the project team, in
particular the relevant software developer. In particular, this concerns
the documentation of any findings from software related activities, e.g. bug
tracking and repeated software testing during the development cycle.



\section{Resources}

Staffing to support software assurance activities must be balanced against the
other activities that are to be carried out within the project at any given time
period and against underlying availability of personnel.

The required resource levels shall be discussed, adjusted and managed in
conjunction with project management to ensure maintainance of adequate support
within the life cycle of the project.


\section{Reporting}

Since the project is not concerned with external partners, reporting is done
informally, rather than via \glspl{SPAMR}.\\

\noindent
Still, these informal reports shall cover:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \gls{SSS} coverage
	\item \gls{SRS} coverage
	\item \gls{SDD} coverage
	\item Testing activities
	\item Verification activities
	\item \gls{NCR} and action status
	\item \gls{SPR} and action status
	\item Product metrics
	\item Compliance and adherance to design and coding standards
	\item Methods and tooling
\end{itemize}

\noindent
No minutes of meeting or other record has to be made of meetings regarding
these informal reports.


\section{Quality models}

In ECSS-Q-ST-80C\cite{ECSS80C}, these potential quality characteristics of a
software application are identified:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item functionality
	\item reliability
	\item maintainability
	\item reusability
	\item suitability for safety
	\item security
	\item usability
	\item efficiency
	\item portability
	\item software development effectiveness
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\noindent
Functionality is explicitly covered in the \gls{SRS}\cite{flightosSRS}. Similarly,
the \gls{SRS} also covers maintainability, safety and security requirements, as
well as efficiency.\\

\noindent
Reliability is covered implicitly through the requirements formulated in the
\gls{TP}\cite{flightosTP} and \gls{TS}\cite{flightosTS}. which are designed to
to demonstrate the ability of the software to satisfy its requirements within
its operational domain.\\

\noindent
Usability is not formally relevant for FlightOS, but rather implied by software
design and its intended application.\\

\noindent
Portability and reusability are implicit by the type of software product
(an embedded operating system).\\

\noindent
Software development effectiveness is not covered explicitly, but is implicitly
covered by the definition of the development process.


\section{Risk Management}

If software-specific risks are identified during development, they shall be
incorporated into a risk portfolio by the \gls{PAM}. The status of corrective
and/or preventive actions shall be tracked, including a a general action plan
and progress per identified risk.\\

\noindent
Given the small group of involved personnel, communication is straightforward
and ensures an efficient flow of information on an informal level.


\section{Supplier selection and control}

\emph{Not applicable.}


\section{Methods and tools}

The following tools are used for the management process:

\begin{description}[labelwidth=4em,leftmargin=\parindent,labelindent=\parindent]
	\item[\textbf{git}]		source code and document version control
	\item[\textbf{TeX Live}]	document preparation
\end{description}


\noindent
The following tools are used for the software development and testing process:

\begin{description}[labelwidth=4em,leftmargin=\parindent,labelindent=\parindent]
	\item[\textbf{sparc-gcc}]	C language compiler for \gls{SPARC}
	\item[\textbf{xentium-clang}]	C language compiler for the \gls{Xentium}
	\item[\textbf{gcov}]		code coverage testing
	\item[\textbf{doxygen}]		in-line software and \gls{API} documentation
\end{description}

\noindent
All of the listed tools are well established and are at a high level of maturity.


\section{Process assessment and improvement}

Assessment and possible improvement of the development process shall be done 
internally on an informal basis.


\section{Operations and maintenance}

No special quality measures are defined for operations or maintenance.



\chapter{Software Process Assurance}


\section{Software development cycle}


\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/agile_sw_dev}
	\caption{The life cycle of the agile software development model.
		 After the initial identification of requirements and a high
		 level description of the software product, steps of
		 implementation of new features and testing are followed
		 by review and approval of those features. If the results
		 of the development are approved, a new version is released.
		 Based on the feedback, the development target is adjusted and
		 the cycle is started over.}
	\label{fig:agile_sw}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent
For the software development life cycle, the \emph{Agile} model (\fig{fig:agile_sw})
is selected to be used for the development of FlightOS.
This model keeps the initial planning and analysis on a very high level that
is just detailed enough to outline the scope of the project. The development
process is a series of iterations, in which a feature is taken from start to
finish during a single iteration and released intermediately during or at the
end of an iteration.
There are no distinct stages during a cycle, but activities
such as analyzing, designing, developing and testing of a feature are executed
in turn within each iteration.

The benefit of this approach is the freedom to quickly and flexibly react to
changing circumstances such as changes to hardware features of the underlying
platform, or evolving use cases for the software product. Changes can be
discussed and new features can be implemented or those with shortcomings removed
or replaced, based on feedback of the user base.
However, since this type of
work requires experienced developers that are capable of independent decision
making and a wide skill set that covers efficient design and implementation, as
well as thorough test conception, adequate personnel must be carefully selected
when staffing.



\section{Project plans}

A \glsdesc{TP} is given in \cite{flightosTP}.


\section{Software dependability and safety}

FlightOS is intended to be used in unmanned space
applications of (at least) Software Criticality Level C. However, \gls{FDIR}
analyses and derived measures as well as the particular configuration of
the operating system to be used are highly dependent on the use case and must
be defined at a different stage. Fundamental dependability on a software
component level is ensured by verification and validation testing as part of the
software development process.


\section{Software documentation and configuration management}

Documents are written and typeset in \LaTeX\ and compiled with the \textbf{TeX Live}
distribution of tools. For configuration management of both documents and source
code, \textbf{git} is used, which provides implicit protection of software and
document versions by cryptographic means.\\

\noindent
Document identification, content, change records and issue/revision handling
shall be oriented along the applicable \gls{DRD} of the corresponding ECSS
standards.\\

\noindent
The \gls{PAM} shall verify any documentation before release as to formal
standards, such as document identifier, completeness of information, date,
issue and revision.\\

\noindent
As part of the preparation of a documentation package for external review, both
the project manager and the \gls{PAM} shall perform a full review of the
contained documentation.\\

\noindent
All released documents, unless otherwise marked, can be considered signed, even
without the inclusion of an actual signature.\\

\noindent
Nonconformance management and closure processes shall follow the procedures
outlined in \cite{ECSS80C} and \cite{ECSSQ1009C} if needed when dealing with
external partners. Internally, \glspl{NCR} are handled informally, no \gls{NRB}
is foreseen to be instated.


\section{Process metrics}

Actions, \glspl{NCR}, \glspl{SPR}, resulting deviations and waivers as
well as \gls{SQA} statistics shall be managed by the \gls{SQAM} as applicable.
No formal method of how records are kept is specified.\\

\noindent
Any recorded metrics shall be made available on demand.\\

\noindent
Metrics regarding the actual program code shall be managed by lead software
developer. These metrics shall be part of test reports if applicable.


\section{Reuse of software}

If software is reused from other projects, a full qualification package shall
be included to the same level of any newly developed code.



\section{Product assurance planning for individual processes and activities}

The \gls{SQA} shall assure that all activities concur with the planning and the
definitions given in this plan.\\

\noindent
Compliance will be monitored informally and internally, accompanying the
development of the software.\\

\noindent
This shall include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item review of data packages as to adequacy and completeness
	\item \gls{RID} management
	\item \gls{NCR} management
	\item \gls{SPR} management
	\item action magement
	\item provision of a \gls{SPAMR} (optional, only if needed)
\end{itemize}


\section{Procedures and standards}

Procedures and standards are described in the preceeding sections of this
document.




\chapter{Software Product Quality Assurance}


Product metrics of the software code include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item number of source lines of code
	\item number of comments
	\item functional complexity (cyclomatic complexity, lines per function, \ldots)
	\item code coverage (via unit tests)
	\item completeness of code commentary/design description
	\item test coverage
