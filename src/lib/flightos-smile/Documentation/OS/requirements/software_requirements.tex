\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose of the Document}

This document specifies the software requirements for the operating system
kernel FlightOS. FlightOS targets the \gls{SSDP}, and to a lesser extent, its
compatible predecessor, the \gls{MPPB} v2.x \cite{MPPB}.
It is intended to be used in unmanned space applications of (at least)
Software Criticality Level C. Readers must be familiar with the basic concepts
of event driven real time operating systems and the target hardware. \\

\noindent
This document follows the document structure for software requirement
specifications found in Annex D of ECSS-E-ST-40C \cite{ECSS40C}.

\section{Scope of the Software}

FlightOS is a lightweight operating system targeting the particular
characteristics of the \gls{SSDP} and is focused on driving the \gls{NoC} and
its attached \gls{Xentium} \gls{DSP} cores.

\chapter{Software Overview}

\section{Function and Purpose}

In the course of the \gls{NGAPP} activities, an evaluation of the \gls{MPPB}
was performed in a joint effort of \gls{RSA} and the Department of Astrophysics
of the \gls{UVIE}. While the original intent of the work of \gls{UVIE} was to
quantify the performance of the \gls{Xentium} \glspl{DSP} and the \gls{MPPB} as a
whole with regard to on-board data treatment and reduction in an astronomical
mission setting, it was found that, given the highly innovative nature of this new
processing platform, a novel approach was needed concerning the management of
system resources, \gls{DMA} mechanics and \gls{DSP} program design for best
efficiency and turnover rates. Consequently, \gls{UVIE} developed an experimental
operating system to stably drive the \gls{DSP} cores and the \gls{MPPB} close
to its performance limit. FlightOS is a development based on this operating system
concept. Along with its intended functionality, it provides full software test
coverage, example applications and good documentation that supports all aspects
of the software.


\section{Environmental considerations}

FlightOS is will support the \gls{SSDP} and also support the
\gls{MPPB} v2.x. Ultimately, this does allow reuse of the operating system core
for \gls{LEON2} and \gls{LEON3} based platforms with minor adaptations.
Even though the \gls{SSDP} does not contain a multi-core \gls{LEON3} processor,
\gls{SMP} support will be prepared in FlightOS, as this will likely change with
newer versions of the \gls{SSDP}.
FlightOS is released under an open source license, so compatible development tools should
be available under such licenses as well. Note that it might still be necessary
to use a commercial product to target particular configurations or proprietary
hardware functionality.


\section{Relation to other systems}

FlightOS is a stand-alone software product.


\section{Constraints}

FlightOS primarily targets the \gls{SSDP}, which effectively limits the hardware
support to the characteristics of this platform. \\
\noindent
The source code is written in C and if required, \gls{SPARC} v8 compatible
assembly. This is necessary as hardware interaction at a machine level requires
programming languages designed for that purpose.



\chapter{Requirements}

\section{General}

%\begin{figure}[ht]
%\begin{center}
%	\includegraphics{images/OS_fundamental_architecture}
%	\caption{The fundamental architecture of FlightOS.}
%	%\label{fig:blackbody_curves}
%\end{center}
%\end{figure}

\requirement{GEN-0001} {No external dependencies}{%
FlightOS shall not make use of external libraries, including C-runtime libraries.
}{}%

\requirement{GEN-0002} {Custom libc functionality}{%
FlightOS shall, as part of its code-base and as needed, provide its own
implementations of typical C-libary functions with an \gls{API} conforming to
their \gls{POSIX} definitions.
}{%
The collection of these functions can also form the base or a subset of a
C libary to be used by applications.}%

\requirement{GEN-0003} {Application libc usage}{%
FlightOS shall optionally call a function that initialises a C-library on startup.
It is up to the user to define and link the implementation of this function and
the according C-library.
}{%
The function \_\_libc\_start\_main() is declared as a weak symbol and tested
before execution.
}%


% TODO: to interface requirements?
% example:
%
% declare:
% __libc\_start\_main() __attribute__((weak));
%
% optional execution:
%
% if (__libc_start_main())
%	__libc_start_main();
% }
% it is executed if the function is actually defined or linked in:
%
%  int __libc_start_main()
% {
%	...
% }

\requirement{GEN-0004} {Fatal Error Management}{%
If a non-recoverable error state is detected in FlightOS, it shall optionally
call an error handling routine provided by the user before issuing a reboot.
FlightOS shall provide a directive to register such a function.
}{%
This gives the user the possiblity to perform a clean shutdown of critical
tasks in their particular environment.}%


\requirement{GEN-0006} {Core runtime}{%
In its basic configuration, FlightOS shall restrict itself to the initialisation
of its core services on a single processor, thereby configuring traps, memories
and timers. All other services or device drivers shall be configured and added
via the build system.
}{}%

\requirement{GEN-0601} {Error Logging}{%
FlightOS shall maintain an error message log that is readable by the user.
}{}%

\requirement{GEN-0602} {Coding Style}{%
FlightOS code shall use the Linux kernel coding style. Source files and patches
shall be checked using the checkpatch.pl utility found in the Linux kernel
source tree.
}{%
A major point of FlightOS is that it does not only come with an open source
license, but should ideally only use tools that are distributable under a
similar license. The Linux kernel is used in billions of devices word-wide,
its coding style is hence arguably well-suited for use in successful software.
}%


\section{Functional Requirements}

\requirement{FUN-0007} {SMP Support}{%
FlightOS shall be able to run on a multi-core configuration of a LEON3 processor.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0803} {MMU Support}{%
FlightOS shall support the use of the MMU of the LEON3 processor.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0008} {Supervisor Mode}{%
The FlightOS kernel shall execute with the SPARC supervisor mode enabled.
Application code shall run with supervisor mode disabled.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0011} {Timing}{%
FlightOS shall provide access to typical time keeping, time taking and delay
timing functionality expected by an operating system.
}{}%


\requirement{FUN-0012} {Task Support}{%
FlightOS shall provide means to create new tasks.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0013} {Task priorities and deadlines}{%
FlightOS shall support the assignment of a priority and a deadline to a task.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0014} {Task scheduling}{%
FlightOS shall offer a fixed priority scheduler with priority inversion handling.
}{}%

\goal{FUN-0015} {Other schedulers}{%
FlightOS should offer an Earliest Deadline First scheduler supporting priority
execution in overload conditions.

}{%
Along with dynamic ticking, this is an option to optimise thread CPU utilisation
with the added benefit of predictable execution for certain high-priority
threads in conditions where the total load unexpectedly would exceed 100\%.
}%

\requirement{FUN-0016} {Kernel Ticks}{%
FlightOS shall operate in tickless (non-periodic) timed wakeup mode by default.
}{%
Tickless timing avoids unnecessary wake-ups of the CPU if no task is running
and improves performance by only switching to kernel mode from regular tasks
when absolutely necessary.
}%

\requirement{FUN-0017} {Tickless Timing}{%
FlightOS timing functionality shall be able to operate in tickless mode, where 
a queue of wakeup times is maintained and a hardware timer is used in such a way
that its next underflow (resulting in an interrupt) is programmed to coincide
with the next wakeup time. New wakeup times shall be inserted into the queue as
needed to maintain the desired timeline of events and the hardware timer
be readjusted accordingly.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0019} {Semaphores and Mutexes}{%
FlightOS shall provide semaphores and mutexes as part of its task functionality.
Task priorities shall be protected by the priority ceiling protocol.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0020} {Tasks and \gls{SMP}}{%
FlightOS shall support task migration between \glspl{CPU} and track and ensure
atomicity of related functions (e.g. mutexes) across multiple processors.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0021} {Message Queues}{%
FlightOS shall support message queues for inter-process communication.
Atomicity of queues shall be ensured across multiple processors.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0022} {Kernel Modules}{%
FlightOS shall offer loadable module support infrastructure.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0804} {Kernel-Userspace Initialisation}{%
FlightOS shall offer a configurable initialisation point that executes a
user-space setup procedure.\\


}{%
This is the point where the application software is loaded.%
}%

\requirement{FUN-0023} {System Control Interface}{%
FlightOS shall offer a way for drivers or other functional modules to export
configuration or state variables into a logical tree maintained by
the operating system. This logical tree shall be accessible by other modules and
the user as a character-based interface.
}{%
This is supposed to be a centrally organised, generic parseable interface to
get or set configuration states or system statistics.
}%

\requirement{FUN-0024} {Binary System Control Interface}{%
FlightOS shall offer the possibility to install binary exchange nodes within the
System Control Interface tree that may be used for larger amouts of binary data.
The binary format shall be defined by the creator of the node. Any users of the
node shall be responsible to read or write in the correct format expected by the
node.%
}{%
Sometimes, a binary dump to or from a subsystem is needed that is only parseable
with special knowledge. This could, for example, be an internal memory dump or
some calibration data.
}%

\goal{FUN-0025} {Device Drivers}{%
FlightOS should come with device drivers for all hardware functionality of the SSDP.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0026} {Xentium Scheduler}{%
FlightOS shall offer a way to define and load Xentium data processing code.
}{}%

\requirement{FUN-0027} {Xentium Data Buffers}{%
FlightOS shall provide packet-driven meta-data buffers to Xentium programs that
can link to arbitrary data sets and routing tables that define the path of
a data packet through a series of Xentium program nodes.
}{%
Datagrams propagate through processing nodes as defined in their routing table,
which represents their individual ``processing chain''.}%


\section{Performance Requirements}

\requirement{GEN-0009} {Traps/Interrupts}{%
FlightOS trap entry and exit code shall not exceed 500 instructions.
}{%
This does not include the callback functions for a trap or interrupt
service routine.
}%

\requirement{GEN-0018} {Deferred saving of \gls{FPU} registers}{%
In trap mode, FlightOS shall defer saving of \gls{FPU} registers until it is
accessed.\\


}{%
This approach saves many clock cycles, as the \gls{FPU} is not typically used
as part of an \gls{ISR}.
}%


\requirement{GEN-0010} {Interrupt downtime}{%
\glspl{ISR} that execute longer than 50 µs shall be set to be executed in
deferred mode at a later time if feasible given the type and rate of an \gls{ISR}.
}{
Interrupt mode should be left as fast as possible, so regular processing can
continue. Most \glspl{ISR} requiring long processing times perform actions on
data, which can typically be moved into a dedicated thread, with the \gls{ISR}
acting as a signalling function.
}%

\requirement{GEN-0028} {Real-Time Thread Support}{%
FlightOS shall offer support for a class of real time threads that may also
preempt the operating sytem with the exception of \glspl{ISR}.
}{%
Some application real time tasks may be so timing sensitive, that even
operating system code must be preemptible to guarantee a timely response.
}%

\section{Interface Requirements}

\requirement{GEN-2001} {Interface Documentation}{%
The internal and external interfaces of FlightOS shall be described as part
of its source code in Doxygen markup.\\

}{
The interfaces of a complex piece of software such as an operating system
often change over time, as it is adapted to new circumstances or improved
implementation of particular functionality or just subtle changes that may not
always propagate into other documents as they should. It is therefore better to
maintain interface documentation together with the code it describes, where it
will be more likely to be updated on the spot.
}%


\section{Operational Requirements}

No operational requirements have been identified.


\section{Resources Requirements}

\requirement{GEN-0101} {Target Platform}{%
FlightOS shall execute on the \gls{SSDP}, in particular the \gls{LEON3-FT}
processor of the platform. It should also execute on the \gls{MPPB} v2.x.
}{}%


\section{Design Requirements and Implementation Constraints}


\requirement{GEN-0801}{Modular Design}{%
All components of FlightOS shall be written such that a particular component does
contain its intended functionality as much as possible.
}{
If something is mostly self-contained, it is easier to modify and re-use in
another software project.
}%

\requirement{GEN-0802}{Software Hierarchy}{%
All components shall make use and rely only on functionality that is lower
in hierarchy. The use of functionality that is hierarchically equal or higher
shall be explicitly forbidden.
}{
Note that hierarchy refers to the abstraction level of a component. An \gls{ISR}
is of higher level than the interrupt dispatcher. Even though it is called by
the latter, the actual registration of the \gls{ISR} is done by a higher level
component. Such constructs are legal, the reliance on user-space provided
functionality, e.g. an error reporting function, which sends messages via some
packet interface on the other hand, is not.
}%


\requirement{GEN-0805}{Programming Language}{%
The programming language shall be C. \gls{SPARC}v8 compatible assembly shall be
used when necessitated by performance or timing constraints and interface
requirements.
}{}%




\section{Security and Privacy Requirements}

No security or privacy requirements have been identified.

\section{Software Quality Requirements}

\goal{GEN-0201} {Product Metrics}{%
FlightOS should have a cyclomatic complexity of at most 15 and a nesting level of
at most 6 per function. Each function shall have a single exit point for the 
nominal case.
}{}%

\section{Software Reliability Requirements}

No software reliability requirements have been identified.

\section{Software Maintainability Requirements}

\requirement{GEN-0301} {Version Identification}{%
It shall be possible to identifiy the version of compiled binary software
components by reading their identifier from a special memory segment.
}{
The build identifier or version number should be set and defined when building
the binary.
}%


\section{Software Safety Requirements}

\requirement{GEN-0401} {Stack Pointer Checks}{%
The stack pointer of a task shall be checked for feasibility before scheduling
the latter.
}{
}%

\requirement{GEN-0402} {Correctable Traps}{%
FlightOS shall provide handlers for correctable traps caused by kernel or user
code and either correctly execute the desired operation (e.g. unaligned access)
or replace the result with a default value (e.g. divison by zero) and skip the
offending code instruction to continue.
}{
}

\requirement{GEN-0403} {Trap Error Reporting}{%
FlightOS shall make an entry into its error message log when a trap event occurs,
describing the nature and source of the trap.
}{
}



\section{Software Configuration and Delivery Requirements}

\requirement{GEN-0005} {Build configuration}{%
FlightOS shall make use of the Linux Kernel Build System (kbuild) for its
configuration.
}{}%


\section{Data Definition and Database Requirements}

No data definition or database requirements have been identified.


\section{Human Factors Related Requirements}

No human factors related requirements have been identified.

\section{Adaptation and Installation Requirements}

No adaptation and installation requirements have been identified.


\chapter{Validation Requirements}

\requirement{GEN-1001} {Verification Method}{%
The verification method and verification activity shall be specified 
in a Software Qualification Test Plan for each requirement.
}{}%

\requirement{GEN-1002} {Qualification Testing}{%
SW qualification testing shall be performed with various configurations of
FlightOS.
}{}%

\chapter{Traceability}

The requirements in this document are both user and system requirements.
Traces from design and test to the software requirements are given in the
respective documents. \cite{flightosADD} \cite{flightosTS}


\chapter{Logical Model Description}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/OS_logical}
	\caption{The logical model of FlightOS. Here, the "hardware" layer
	represents both the hardware and the hardware abstraction layer of
	the software.}
	\label{fig:logical_model}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In FlightOS, the \gls{SSDP} hardware is accessed in multiple layers of
abstraction (see \fig{fig:logical_model}). Typical \gls{CPU} tasks such as thread/task
management and timer operation are used as part of the operating system kernel
and are also accessible by user applications via a system call interface.
Other functional hardware components of the \gls{SSDP} such as the \gls{NoC}
\gls{DMA} have their own driver modules. These are in turn used by the
\gls{Xentium} scheduler and other higher level modules in the operating system.
Configuration of and access to the latter from user space is done via a system
call interface. The system control interface serves as an intermediate between
all layers of the operating system, where system or module states and hardware
modes or usage statistics may be exported by individual components for external
(user) access.
