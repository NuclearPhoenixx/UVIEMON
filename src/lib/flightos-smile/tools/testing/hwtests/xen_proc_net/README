Description:
============

This test configures and executes the  Xentium Processing Network Demonstrator
and evaluates success or failure.
The supplied shell script can be used in conjunction with git bisect run <...>

Pass/Fail Criterea:
===================

The demonstrator will print a line containing SUCCESS if the test passes
successfully, all other conditions are considered a failure.

The shell script will also fail the test if its execution lasts for more
than 120 seconds. This is done to detect situations where the grmon or
the hardware platform becomes stuck. In such a situation, the exit code
returned will be 125, as to indicate to git bisect, that the current
configuration can not be tested.


Prerequisites:
==============

	* MPPB v2.x
	* DEBUG UART connected to /dev/ttyS0
	* grmon v1.1.x


Notes:
======

The current .config of FlightOS will be overwritten and the image will
be rebuilt.
