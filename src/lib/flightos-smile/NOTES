Patches and improvements are always welcome.
Please consider that I barely had 3 months to prepare all of this from start to
finish, so some things may not be particularly smart or pretty, or even
complete.


MPPB (v2)
=======

* NoC DMA channels silently fail and can not be reset when source and
  destination of a transfer falls programmed within the same memory
  (this may not be true, I have not tried programming zero-sized transfers yet)

* There is no atomic mechanism that protects against concurrent programming
  of NoC DMA channels. This means that a Xentium needs to either reserve one
  or more channels for a time, or all channels must be assigned beforehand 

* there is no MMU

Xentium
=======

* Xentium-Clang cannot produce position independent executables, which makes
  memory management less comfortable
