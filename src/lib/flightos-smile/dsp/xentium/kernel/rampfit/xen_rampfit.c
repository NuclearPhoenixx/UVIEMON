 *
 * NOTE: This is for demonstration purposes only. There are lot of things that
 * are not verified/handled/you name it, but the purpose of this kernel
 * is to show off the what can be done and how with the resources available.
 * This includes:
 *	- command exchange with the host processor
 *	- access to processing tasks
 *	- complex DMA transfer
 *	- kmalloc/kfree via the host processor
 *	- integration of custom (really seariously very superfast) assembly for
 *	  the actual processing
 *
 * NOTE: the number of samples per ramp must be a multiple of 4

	 * How this is done: the ramp fit assembly implementation we use here
	 * expects us to deliver the data in two parallel TCM banks, which
	 * should be banks 1 and 3, which in principle allows us to work on
	 * ramps of up to 8192 samples total, which must be stored in two bank
	 * groups sequentially but "de-interleaved", so there are no same-bank
	 * access conflicts of the Xentiums E units and we may load 4 samples at
	 * in every clock cycle:

	 *  ⎮    1     2     3     4
	 *  ⎮ +-----+-----+-----+-----+

	 *  ⎮ ⎮  7  ⎮ 21  ⎮  8  ⎮ 22  ⎮
	 *  ⎮ +-----+-----+-----+-----+
	 *  +____v
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 * To set this up, we'll perform a DMA transfer to split the linear
	 * sequences of ramp data into the banks.
	 *
	 * We instruct the DMA to consider the data in a shape that is 2 columns
	 * by n/2 rows. Iterating over the source, it will take items from
	 * columns sequentially and place the into the target with an offset of
	 * 2 bank sizes apart (b3 - b1). It will then forward-skip two columns
	 * to reach the next row, but perform no skip at the target, because
	 * there the column shape is 1 column by n/2 rows.
